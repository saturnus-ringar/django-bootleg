In some operating systems, the null device is a device file that discards all data written to it but reports that the
write operation succeeded. This device is called /dev/null on Unix and Unix-like systems, NUL: or NUL on CP/M and DOS
(internally \DEV\NUL), nul on newer Windows systems[1] (internally \Device\Null on Windows NT),
NIL: on Amiga operating systems,[2] and NL: on OpenVMS.[3] In Windows Powershell, the equivalent is $null.[4]
It provides no data to any process that reads from it, yielding EOF immediately.[5] In IBM DOS/360, OS/360 (MFT, MVT),
OS/390 and z/OS operating systems, such files would be assigned in JCL to DD DUMMY.
